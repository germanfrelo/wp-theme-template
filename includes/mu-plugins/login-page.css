/**
 * Login page styles
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Copy this CSS file together with `login-page.php` into the target site's
 *   `wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory. Keep these files colocated.
 * - To provide a custom logo for the login page, add `login-logo.svg` next to
 *   these files in `wp-content/mu-plugins/`. The CSS uses a relative URL so the
 *   asset is resolved from the same folder as this stylesheet.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Sanitize the SVG logo before deploying (remove scripts,
 *   `<foreignObject>`, or `on*` handlers). Consider using `svgo` or a PHP SVG
 *   sanitizer as part of your intake process.
